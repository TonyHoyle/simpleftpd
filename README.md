Implementation of SFTP (Simple FTP - RFC913) https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc913

Not to be confused with Secure FTP which is a much later and more complex protocol

Although this is largely unused today, it's useful in some cases for example where
you have a device that can only open a single channel to send/receive data, and
more modern protocols are too heavy an implementation.
